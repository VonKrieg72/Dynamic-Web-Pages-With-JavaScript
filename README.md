# Dynamic-Web-Pages-With-JavaScript

## JavaScript

JavaScript (JS) is a programming language that allows you to implement complex things on web pages. For example, anytime a web page does complex things such as displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics or scrolling video jukeboxes, as oppossed to just sitting there and displaying static information, chances are JavaScript has some involvement. JavaScript is well known as the scripting language for web pages. However, many non browser environments such as [Node.js](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Node.js), [Apache CouchDB](https://couchdb.apache.org), and [Adobe Acrobat](https://opensource.adobe.com/dc-acrobat-sdk-docs/acrobatsdk/) also use it. The style of programming that JavaScript uses is a [prototype-based](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Prototype-based_programming), multi-paradigmed, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative. The standards for JavaScript are the [ECMAScript Language Specification](https://tc39.es/ecma262/)(ECMA-262) and the [ECMAScript Internationalization API specification](https://tc39.es/ecma402/) (ECMA-402). The JavaScript documentation throughout MDN is based on the lastest draft versions of ECMA-262 and ECMA-402. Keep in mind that JavaScript is not to be confused with Java programming language. They are both trademarked by the same company; however, the two programming languages have very different syntax, semantics and use.
